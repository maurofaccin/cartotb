### CartoTB world map

In this map you can experience different levels of granularity in the prediction of the incidence rate.

- The coarser (the one displayed in this moment) is the one with less information;
- At higher zoom we add the information about the population distribution;
- At even higher zoom, we use plenty of data (mines location, health care location, etc.);
- At city level (try to zoom to Kigali in Rwanda) we expose incidence levels inferred from satellite images.
