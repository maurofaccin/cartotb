### CartoTB world map, a didactical example.

In this map you can experience different levels of granularity in the estimation of the incidence rate.

- The coarser (the one displayed at this moment) is the one with less information (only the country average incidence rate);
- At higher zoom we add the information about the population distribution;
- At higher zoom levels (check the Kivu region in DRC and Rwanda), we use plenty of data (mines location, health care location, etc.);
- At city level (try to zoom to Kigali in Rwanda) we expose incidence levels inferred from satellite images.
