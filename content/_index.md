Thanks to a research fund granted by the Brussels Region in Belgium ([Innoviris](https://www.innoviris.be)), a consortium of Universities ([UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/) and [KULeuven](https://www.kuleuven.be)) and a start-up active in the development of innovative tools for international health ([Savics](http://www.savics/org)) are developing innovative solutions to help:

- to target very precisely the geographical areas throughout the world with a very high risk of tuberculosis;
- to facilitate the operational response to address them.

This site is dedicated to the first chapter, see [here for more informations](about).

We invite you to visit Savics [Mediscout](https://www.savics.org/mediscout) website for more information on the operational tools developed.
